Today I accidentally deleted my LevelUpdater script but thats okay because my LevelUpdater script is only about 20 lines long and has some very simle logic. I also deleted the CelebrateLevelUp because I feel like it doesnt really fit, I might do something else in the future though. I also changed the Tween script a bit so I can debug and change later. In my upgrade script I added the ability to get more money per click but I still need to do some math stuff so it is balanced. Finally, I also changed the map around a bit because the shelves at the end of the isles arent the same length as the 2 wide ones. Thats it for now but I did update the blog by adding `single code line!` and code blocks but they are broken atm.

```js{1,3-5}[CodeBlocks.js]
print("We have Awesome Code Blocks now in both dark and light mode!")
