Hey guys, recently I've been quiet on twitter because I've been working on 
this and there's nothing to tweet about. I have fixed a couple of bugs, and made some 
improvements. I would also like to mention I no longer do game dev, 
I wasn't having fun making games and I dont want to do something that isn't fun. But with all 
of that out of the way let's see what I've changed.


## Changelog:
1. Added my web development projects to the front page
1. Fixed some routing stuff that had caused some cosmetic issues
1. Changed the blog listing screen
1. I also changed about the layout of my blog posts

After all of that I would like to thank every coming back here for supporting me, 
and if you haven't already check out my [twitter](https://twitter.com/julie4055_).
